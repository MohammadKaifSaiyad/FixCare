# Changelog

Significant changes, most recent first. Rolling ~30-day window — older entries
can be trimmed. The *live* project state lives in [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md);
this is the history of how it got there.

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD` headers, bullet entries. Update every session.

- **Added project skills + custom agents.** Expanded `.claude/` with FixCare-specific
  automation (generic workflow stays with Superpowers):
  - 4 new backend skills: `prisma-schema-model`, `keystone-handshake`,
    `bullmq-worker` (backend-only — apps use in-app retry, not BullMQ),
    `third-party-wrapper`. (Now 7 backend skills total.)
  - 4 new Flutter/apps skills (first app-side skills): `flutter-feature`,
    `api-repository`, `camera-evidence-capture`, `riverpod-provider`.
  - 4 read-only review agents in `.claude/agents/`: `golden-rules-auditor`,
    `prisma-migration-reviewer`, `flutter-widget-reviewer`, `fraud-vector-checker`.
  - Listed them in `CLAUDE.md` → "Project Skills & Agents". Each cites its source doc.

- **Project setup (pre-development).** Established the working structure so the
  documented Claude-Code + Superpowers workflow can actually run:
  - Initialized git (single **monorepo**, trunk = `main`) and committed the
    existing planning docs.
  - Scaffolded `apps/{backend,admin,customer,technician}` + `packages/shared-types`
    with purpose READMEs; stub `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + `docker-compose.yml`.
  - Created the missing docs folders (`06-operations`, `adrs`, `designs`,
    `plans`, `decisions`, `progress/weekly-notes`) with index READMEs.
  - Reconciled conflicting artifact paths → `docs/designs` + `docs/plans`;
    pinned Superpowers brainstorming output to `docs/designs`.
  - Renamed the technician actor **"Worker" → "Technician"** across all docs
    (preserving BullMQ/background-job "worker" terminology).
  - Added the progress-tracking system: `STATUS.md` + weekly-notes template,
    wired into the session ritual in `CLAUDE.md`.
  - Added 3 project-level skills: `scaffold-module`, `zod-validated-route`,
    `audit-logged-mutation`.
  - Wrote ADR-0001 (monorepo), ADR-0002 (trunk-based branching),
    ADR-0003 (worker→technician).
