# Changelog

Significant changes, most recent first. Rolling ~30-day window — older entries
can be trimmed. The *live* project state lives in [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md);
this is the history of how it got there.

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD` headers, bullet entries. Update every session.

- **Project setup (pre-development).** Established the working structure so the
  documented Claude-Code + Superpowers workflow can actually run:
  - Initialized git (single **monorepo**, trunk = `main`) and committed the
    existing planning docs.
  - Scaffolded `apps/{backend,admin,customer,technician}` + `packages/shared-types`
    with purpose READMEs; stub `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + `docker-compose.yml`.
  - Created the missing docs folders (`06-operations`, `adrs`, `designs`,
    `plans`, `decisions`, `progress/weekly-notes`) with index READMEs.
  - Reconciled conflicting artifact paths → `docs/designs` + `docs/plans`;
    pinned Superpowers brainstorming output to `docs/designs`.
  - Renamed the technician actor **"Worker" → "Technician"** across all docs
    (preserving BullMQ/background-job "worker" terminology).
  - Added the progress-tracking system: `STATUS.md` + weekly-notes template,
    wired into the session ritual in `CLAUDE.md`.
  - Added 3 project-level skills: `scaffold-module`, `zod-validated-route`,
    `audit-logged-mutation`.
  - Wrote ADR-0001 (monorepo), ADR-0002 (trunk-based branching),
    ADR-0003 (worker→technician).
